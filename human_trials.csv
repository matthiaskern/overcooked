1,5,4,16,Yes,"Reasonable, seems to know what to do, doesn’t block my actions. If I let it do something, it will do it smartly",,
1,9,4,20,Yes,"It knew what I’m seeking, sometimes I want to put the vegetable in the plate and it will take the plate. So it might not know that I can put the vegetable directly into the plate",,
2,3,2,16,Yes,"Didn’t make intentions clear, stopped for a few steps, could have taken the plate. It feels competitive, feels like the agent gets rewarded for delivering the food, rather than helping",,
2,5,2,20,Yes,"The same as previous, didn’t notice a clear difference",,
3,3,3,39,Yes,"I spent a lot of time waiting for the robot to leave the plate, something can be improved with the understanding of the rules of the game. Like you cannot deliver things without the table.",,
3,5,4,15,Yes,"Task was completed, even though human doesn’t work. It proves that the llm can solve the task and is good. Because I want to see how can the agent work as a single agent I didn’t move.",,
4,3,3,20,Yes,"It’s not helping me, but also not blocking me",,
4,5,5,18,Yes,"Great collaboration, I put the tomato on the chopping board and the agent came and helped deliver it to the serving plate. It seemed like he know what to do and what I want him to do. But the agent doesn’t help me unless I’m far away, otherwise he will try not to block me.",,
